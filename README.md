# Abstract
This paper investigates the interpretation and perception of musical phrases within a digital musicology context, focusing on Moment Musical nÂ°1 by Schubert. Through detailed analysis of MIDI velocity, dynamic contours, and rhythmic patterns, we explore how phrase boundaries are articulated in both symbolic scores and human performances. Our research involves the development of a computational model 1 designed to identify phrase boundaries, which we then test on a larger dataset to evaluate its effectiveness. Understanding phrases is a key component to be able to create human-like rendition of music by computer.
